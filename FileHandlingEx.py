Basic terminology of programming language

1.compiler - low level convert
2.High leve - .class create (source code)
3.low level - machine code (.pyc) python compile file
4.interpeter - line by line code execute
5.algorithm - step by step to execute the program

'''


'''
python have interpreter language and have
compiler and interpret both the python have


'''


'''

.java - run on PVM - python virtual machine
'''



'''
cthon
json  - java python

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based, 
language-independent data-interchange format.

what is python ->
    1.high level
    2.dynamic type language - 
    3.interpreter
    4.easy to read and write
    5.oops support
    6.free and open souce
    7.general purpose  - (all type) it is not designed for one specific area, but rather is versatile 
    enough to be used across a wide range of application domains
    8.support multiple paradigam

'''
python feature -?

    1.platform independent
    2.use for web development
    3.auto memeory management
    4.standrd library
    5.support multiple programming

'''


'''
dynamic type -> js, python, R  (no need to declare data type)
static type -> java


'''


'''
.py -> create file
.pyc ->   (generate compiler and uderstand machine low level)A .pyc file contains the compiled bytecode of a Python source file, which
the Python interpreter generates to speed up the loading and startup time of Python 
programs. These files are not human-readable or meant for manual editing


'''


'''
platfrom independent -> write once run enywhere (.pyc) 
Platform independence means software can run on any platform (operating system and architecture)
without needing modification or recompilation. 

cross platform independent -> Cross-platform means the software is 
available on multiple platforms, but may require a specific build or interpreter for each one.



platform in -> code portability

cross platform -> application portability
UI ->
tkinter

What is variable -> store dataype

container to store value
onject is variable


identifier - it is protected variable


identity of the 
and it must not be keyword



_ (single undercore) - > protected variable
__ (double underscore) - > privated variable

'''

'''
pastel case ->
camel case -> fiest not another upport
sneck case - < using undercore

naming convention -> A-Z, a-z, allowd
numeric allowd but last of the variable ex: num1


Camel case -> (often styled camelCase) is a capitalization convention 
used in programming and text to join words without spaces, where each word 
begins with a capital letter except for the first one (e.g., myVariableName)

'''

num1 = num2 = 30
#  muliple varible assign single value

# alternate way to write code of fibonacies
num1, num2 = num2, num1 + num2



'''
datatype -> 
fundamental -> int, float. string, store immutable datatype with single value

memoery assign -> memroy assign to value
num1 = 10
num2 = 10
num3 = 10

assign one merory for tempory for all variable

collective -> a dataype contain multiple (collection of more than on element)
memory assign

immutable not changeble 


mutable changeble - > CRUD operation perform


del apply on mutable and immutable
